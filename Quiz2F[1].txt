

	Base in our observation and as we checked the system unit we found that the fuse of the power supply was defective.
That's why we fail to check the other parts of the system unit if there are other parts that is defective. We have also observed 
that the system unit is dusty, and the wires can be easily tear apart, meaning, it is already old, and this situation can already 
affect the system unit.
	So, I recommend to clean the system unit. Replace the fuse and other parts that is already old, or buy a new power supply 
or new system unit.
