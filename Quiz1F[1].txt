WHY DOES THE RASPBERRY PI FUNCTIONING?

	The raspberry pi is functioning because an operating system is already installed on it,
and the wires that we used in connecting the raspbery pi and the projector are in good condition.
Specially the charger that we used that serves as the power supply is functioning and it was in 
good condition.
	All this answer is according to Neil Cotacte, a student from the other section because the've
tried using the raspberry pi. And also, according to Christian Lloyd Salon, our classmate, becuase he did
some research. We also found answers in this site; elinux.org/R.Pi_troubleshooting.
